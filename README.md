ℓ₁-Regularized Least Squares via Proximal Gradient Methods
Overview
This project studies first-order optimization methods for solving the ℓ₁-regularized least squares problem (LASSO), with a focus on proximal gradient descent (ISTA). The goal is to connect convex optimization theory with practical algorithmic behavior, particularly sparsity emergence and convergence dynamics.
The work emphasizes controlled numerical experiments on synthetic data rather than black-box library usage, highlighting how algorithm design choices affect empirical performance.
